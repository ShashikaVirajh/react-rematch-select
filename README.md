- Tried to provide a complete example to the developers who wants to easily get used to this amazing library.
- This covers, integrating rematch to a react project, creating custom selectors using rematch/select and using them inside components.

NOTE: If the APIs are not working, please add this chrome pluging.
CORS Unblock (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en)

Sometimes these APIs are not working. It must be due to the free plan of cocktaildb. Make sure to remove this plugging once the testing is done.
